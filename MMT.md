### Translation Quality Standard: Modified Machine Translation (MMT)

#### Level Overview
**MMT** (Modified Machine Translation) refers to a translation initially produced by machine translation software and then partially edited for errors. While some machine-generated mistakes have been corrected, the text retains signs of its machine-generated origin and remains challenging for readers to fully understand. MMT translations often exhibit improved clarity over pure machine translation but fall short of the fluency, precision, and natural flow expected in professional human translation.

This level signifies that while a human reviewer has made adjustments, the effort was limited, leaving errors or unnatural phrasing that still hinder readability.

#### Defining Characteristics of MMT Translations
1. **Partial Correction of Literal Translations**
   - Basic, easily identifiable errors in the MT output may have been addressed, but more nuanced issues, like cultural adaptation or idiomatic language, remain.

2. **Improved but Incomplete Grammar and Syntax Edits**
   - Some grammar mistakes are corrected, yet awkward structures and rigid syntax from the machine translation persist, causing disjointed readability.

3. **Incomplete Terminology Adjustments**
   - Key terms may be partially corrected, but inconsistencies still exist, leading to potential confusion in complex or specialized texts.

4. **Inconsistent Idiomatic Adaptation**
   - Certain idioms may be translated more accurately, while others are left in literal form or clumsily adapted, breaking the natural flow.

5. **Overall Readability and Comprehension Challenges**
   - The text is more readable than unmodified machine translation but remains awkward, making comprehension difficult for readers who are unfamiliar with the subject.

#### Examples of MMT-Level Translations
##### Example 1:
**Source (English):**  
"The project requires a lot of patience, as many unforeseen issues may arise."

**MMT Translation (Chinese):**  
"该项目需要很多耐心，因为可能出现许多意外问题。"  
(*Issues:* The translation is understandable but could be refined for a more natural flow. The phrase "可能出现许多意外问题" is slightly awkward.)

**Correct Translation (Chinese):**  
"该项目需要很大的耐心，因为可能会遇到许多意想不到的问题。"  
(*Improved:* Flows more naturally in Chinese and captures the original meaning more precisely.)

---

##### Example 2:
**Source (English):**  
"He faced the music for his actions, taking full responsibility for the consequences."

**MMT Translation (Chinese):**  
"他为自己的行为面对音乐，承担全部后果的责任。"  
(*Issues:* “面对音乐” is a literal translation of the idiom “face the music,” which does not make sense in Chinese. Partial editing overlooked this expression.)

**Correct Translation (Chinese):**  
"他直面自己的行为，承担全部后果。"  
(*Improved:* Uses a natural expression in Chinese to convey the intended meaning without awkward phrasing.)

---

##### Example 3:
**Source (English):**  
"After much deliberation, the committee decided to proceed with the proposed changes."

**MMT Translation (Chinese):**  
"经过很多思考，委员会决定进行提出的更改。"  
(*Issues:* The phrase "进行提出的更改" is directly influenced by MT and sounds awkward. It lacks the natural cohesion expected in Chinese.)

**Correct Translation (Chinese):**  
"经过慎重考虑，委员会决定接受提议的更改。"  
(*Improved:* Uses natural phrasing and better reflects the intended meaning.)

#### Identifying an MMT Translation
MMT translations are often characterized by:
- Basic error correction but persistent machine translation “traces” like rigid or literal syntax.
- Improved grammar, but with awkward sentence structures that are not fully optimized for readability.
- Partial correction of terminology, leaving inconsistencies or inaccuracies in specialized terms.
- Mixed idiomatic adaptation, where some expressions may sound natural while others appear literal or stilted.

MMT translations provide an understanding of the text but lack the fluency and cultural accuracy of a professional human translation. While serviceable for readers who need only a basic understanding, they require additional revision for publication.

**Summary**

MMT-level translations reflect partial post-editing of machine-translated text, correcting some errors but leaving room for substantial improvement. These translations need further refinement to be clear, culturally appropriate, and naturally readable, making this level suitable for drafts but not final publication.
