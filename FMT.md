### Translation Quality Standard: Full Machine Translation (FMT)

#### Level Overview
**FMT** (Full Machine Translation) designates a translation primarily produced by a machine translation (MT) tool with minimal human intervention. At this level, the translation text often retains recognizable machine-generated patterns, with numerous mistranslations, awkward phrasing, and lack of cultural adaptation. FMT translations may demonstrate basic comprehension of the source language but often fail to achieve fluency, coherence, or readability in the target language.

This level implies that the translator or reviewer did not make sufficient edits to improve readability or correct significant errors. Consequently, FMT translations can convey the general message but may leave readers confused or require further interpretation.

#### Defining Characteristics of FMT Translations
1. **Literal Translations with Minor Adjustments**
   - The text retains a mostly word-for-word format, with minor adjustments (e.g., basic grammar corrections) but lacks deeper adaptation for natural readability in Chinese.

2. **Common Machine Translation Artifacts**
   - Repetitive or awkward sentence structures commonly produced by MT algorithms are left unchanged, making the text sound artificial or robotic.

3. **Inconsistent Terminology and Contextual Errors**
   - Key terms and contextually sensitive phrases are often mistranslated, showing no sign of manual adjustment for accuracy, especially with technical terms or industry jargon.

4. **Basic Grammar Corrections Only**
   - Simple grammatical errors may be addressed, but more complex restructuring is neglected, leaving issues like unnatural syntax and phrasing.

5. **Limited Cultural and Idiomatic Adaptation**
   - Expressions with cultural or idiomatic significance are translated literally, often leading to confusion or misinterpretation.

#### Examples of FMT-Level Translations
##### Example 1:
**Source (English):**  
"Our team is developing a new software platform that will enable real-time data analysis."

**FMT Translation (Chinese):**  
"我们的团队正在开发一个新软件平台，将启用实时数据分析。"  
(*Issues:* The phrasing is somewhat robotic and lacks natural fluency. “启用实时数据分析” sounds like a direct machine translation without human editing.)

**Correct Translation (Chinese):**  
"我们的团队正在开发一个新的软件平台，以实现实时数据分析。"  
(*Improved:* Flows more naturally in Chinese and uses appropriate phrasing.)

---

##### Example 2:
**Source (English):**  
"He finally bit the bullet and decided to move to another city."

**FMT Translation (Chinese):**  
"他最后咬了子弹并决定搬到另一个城市。"  
(*Issues:* “咬了子弹” is a literal translation of the idiom “bite the bullet,” which does not make sense in Chinese. A human touch would adapt this idiom appropriately.)

**Correct Translation (Chinese):**  
"他最终下定决心，决定搬到另一个城市。"  
(*Improved:* Uses an idiomatic expression in Chinese to convey the intended meaning.)

---

##### Example 3:
**Source (English):**  
"The report indicates that further investigation is necessary to understand the root cause of the problem."

**FMT Translation (Chinese):**  
"报告显示，进一步调查是必要的，以了解问题的根本原因。"  
(*Issues:* Although grammatically correct, the phrasing sounds awkward and mechanical, a common issue with MT output. It’s not particularly reader-friendly.)

**Correct Translation (Chinese):**  
"报告显示，需要进一步调查以了解问题的根本原因。"  
(*Improved:* This restructuring sounds more fluent and natural in Chinese.)

#### Identifying an FMT Translation
An FMT translation can often be identified by:
- Consistent use of literal translations with only minor grammar fixes.
- Presence of machine translation “signatures” like repetitive phrasing and awkward syntax.
- Limited correction of key terminology or idiomatic language, leading to confusing or misleading translations.
- Lack of cultural and contextual adaptation, resulting in literal, often incorrect translations of idioms and phrases.

FMT translations may be serviceable for basic understanding but lack the depth, accuracy, and readability necessary for high-quality translation. This level typically requires moderate to extensive editing to reach a publishable standard.

**Summary**

FMT-level translations exemplify the limitations of machine translation when used without significant human intervention. They require careful post-editing to correct terminology, improve readability, and ensure that the translation accurately conveys the source material’s nuances and context.
