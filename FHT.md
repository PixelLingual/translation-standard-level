### Translation Quality Standard: Full Human Translation (FHT)

#### Level Overview
**FHT** (Full Human Translation) represents translations created entirely by individuals with English as a second language and Chinese as their native language. Texts at this level are typically accurate, faithful to the source material, and generally easy to read. FHT translations are characterized by a solid command of both languages, with accurate rendering of meaning and cultural nuances. While they may lack the subtle refinement of a translation by a bilingual expert, they are well-crafted, clear, and appropriate for most uses.

This level indicates a high standard of translation that is accessible, accurate, and effective in conveying the source message without requiring further editing.

#### Defining Characteristics of FHT Translations
1. **Accurate Meaning and Contextual Fidelity**
   - The translation preserves the original meaning accurately, avoiding common pitfalls such as literal translations or mistranslated idioms.

2. **Cultural Adaptation and Fluency**
   - Expressions, idioms, and cultural references are rendered in a way that feels natural to a native Chinese reader, showing an understanding of contextual nuances.

3. **Readable and Smooth Sentence Structure**
   - Sentences are structured in a way that feels comfortable and fluent in Chinese, ensuring ease of comprehension without requiring significant rephrasing.

4. **Consistent Terminology**
   - Terminology, especially for specialized or technical content, is used consistently and accurately, reflecting a strong understanding of both languages.

5. **Minor Stylistic Improvements Possible**
   - The translation may benefit from minor stylistic edits to enhance readability or flow, but these are generally not essential, as the text is already readily comprehensible.
